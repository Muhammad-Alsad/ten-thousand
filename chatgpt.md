 Handle calculating score for dice roll
 Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class.
 The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.

## Code
    - import random

     @staticmethod
     def calculate_score(dice):
        """
        Calculates the score for a given dice roll.

    - The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the rollâ€™s score according to rules of game.
    Handle rolling dice
    Add roll_dice static method to GameLogic class.
    The input to roll_dice is an integer between 1 and 6.
    The output of roll_dice is a tuple with random values between 1 and 6.
    The length of tuple must match the argument given to roll_dice method.

   - In the calculate_score method, we first calculate the score for each individual die based on whether it is a 1 or a 5. Then, we check for sets of three or more dice with the same value and calculate the score accordingly. Finally, we subtract points for any remaining ones or fives.
   - In the roll_dice method, we use a list comprehension to generate a tuple of random values between 1 and 6 with a length equal to the num_dice argument.
    - update spme code with conditions         
    - add roll_dice to game logic
